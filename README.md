# Oi! Need Help!

The wallpaper change feature only works for windows since changing wallpaper is different accross different platforms. It will be a great help if you can help me up with `GNU\Linux` and `MacOS` integration. Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Muhimen123/tapetti/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further help. Thanks!
